# Hello, Neighbor!

Hi, I’m Dottie. You’re reading this, so you must be a civic-minded person who cares enough to get to know your next state representative.

My Roots
I was born and raised in Belleville, Illinois. Attended Eastern Illinois University, graduated with a Bachelor’s of Science degree. I have two children Asher and Gracie. And our dog, Duke.

My dad was a Pipefitter, my mom a Secretary. My Dad belonged to the local Pipefitter’s Union and still does. But, like me, Dad’s a conservative who often bucked the union line. He taught me you can be a union man and a conservative. As we learned in November 2016, there are a lot of us.

Bucking the unions takes courage, especially when you’re a union member. And courage matters.

Courage to so “no” to bigger government.

Courage to say “yes” to liberty.

Courage to speak the truth when lies will get you invited to the cool kids’ club.

Well, I don’t get into the cool kids’ club because I try to speak the truth. Or, as Jordan Peterson says, at least not lie.

### My Activism

When my children were both in diapers and I was a stay at home mom, I began reading history again. I re-educated myself, and those histories sparked my involvement. I realized if I didn’t get out and start helping and doing something to preserve our republic, then I had no right to sit around and crab about it. No one changes anything sitting on their couch, except, maybe, the TV channel. I learned that the citizens can change their government. But change takes action, not talk.

I have met many dear friends and mentors along the way. Without these amazing grassroots friends that have the same heart that I do for liberty in America made our actions effective, worthwhile and filled with joy. Nothing feels as liberating and exhilarating as pledging your life, your wealth, and your sacred honor to protecting American liberty.

### My Full Immersion

Dottie Bailey with a butcher at Sam’s Meat Market in Ferguson in August 2014.
After the first Ferguson riots, a friend said: “let’s go and help those businesses.” So we did. We organized a band of folks from West County to help the those affected by the riots. We wanted to reward the courageous small business owners who refused to pack up and leave Ferguson.

I was hesitant, of course. But that first Ferguson BUYcot remains one of my most favorite days. The affected people welcomed us with open arms. We let them talk, heard their stories, and made unlikely friendships.

I learned another lesson from the BUYcotts: an encouraging word or action from a stranger is worth more than gold. That day, we lit a candle instead of cursing the darkness. I was able to set up a GoFundMe account for one of the affected businesses there, and its owner is still one of my best friends to this day. We connected on a human level, even though we couldn’t be more different.

### Liberty and Justice for All

My group of friends and I were able to also help push former State Senator Eric Schmitt’s Municipal Court Reform bill. We wanted to end what former Senator Schmitt called “taxation by citation.” We saw the issue as a liberty problem, as some municipalities, especially in North St. Louis County, used their courts to shake down citizens. Now, I have a new habit. If I see some news story or hear of someone hurting, I go and see them. I then use my resources of a network of folks, agencies, charities, and organizations to relieve their suffering.

### Closer to Home

In my town of Eureka, I joined my neighbors in the fight against the Winter Brother’s Mining company that wanted to put another mine here in Eureka. The traffic changes and the additional large trucks would have damaged our streets and created numerous problems for our citizens. We mobilized, fought back, and won. I was very proud of my community for coming together as one and using our self-governance to take back control of this issue.

### My Career and Other Causes

I’ve been in the banking business most of my career. In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was passed, and the gargantuan CFPB, an unaccountable, unelected, unregulated bureaucracy was born. The CFPB, which stands for Consumer Finance Protection Board, was not a check for the purpose of helping the consumer. It actually hurt many consumers through massive regulation. I teamed up with The Heritage Foundation in Washington DC, through their action arm known as Heritage Action for America, and helped form the Real-Estate Sentinel Program. Being the grassroots arm for them, we teamed with Heritage to develop ways to push back on this massive regulating bureaucratic giant. Today as de-regulation is slowly rolling back the excesses of the last administration, I am proud to be a part of that original team that began that wheel to move that giant. In 2016, I was awarded the Heritage Action Wall of Honor Award for my grassroots conservative efforts.

I served on the St. Louis Mortgage Bankers Board of Governors from 2017 to the present and on the board of the St. Louis Tea Party Coalition Board since August 2015.
